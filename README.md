The properties of the task model are task title, task description,date and completion (YES or NO). In one of the controllers, users are able to add task. These task should be displayed to the tableView. The tableView should allow the deletion and reordering of the tasks. Users are able to alter the task from YES to NO by tapping on the cell. The UITableViewCell should change its color depending upon its completion status and/or whether the task is overdue. The tableView also have an accessory button to transition to a ViewController which should display detailed description about the task. From the detailed information ViewController users can transition to a new ViewController which allows the editing of the task.
